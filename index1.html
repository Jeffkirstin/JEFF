<p>since the arrival of covid 19, most people have been affected in various ways.The following are some of the few effects that we witnessed due to covid 19
    <ol>
    <li>Loss of jobs</li>
    <li>loss of resouces</li>
    <li>loss of loved ones</li>
    <li>closure of worshiping places</li>
</ol>
Most societies that live below the poverty line were the most affected because of their financial statuses.However, the efforts that the government made particularly in kenya<br>
was some how good, but not to satisfaction. 
<p>Most people witnessed serious and ubrupt loss of jobs, this is because COVID 19 rules and regulations required that there should be no congestion at working places and a social<br>
distance of <em>one metre</em> be observed, so the only way to cope up with the situation was to reduce the number of workers.
</p>
<p>Health facilities got congested and the developing countries like kenya found it hard to manage the situations, the top hospitals in the city were only preseverd to those who were<br>
financial able.People who were depleted of the resourses could not manage the high cost of medications offered at the top hospitals in the country, this led to even more deatths</p>
