      <head><b><h1>POSIVITE EFFCTS OF TECHNOLOGY</h1></b></head>
         <p>We have much to say about today's technology. Since the dawn of 21<sup>st</sup>Century, much have been achieved in technlogy as compared to when the former <br>
            legends scientists and phycisists left it.We are very proud for the various onsets in this sector.The <mark>positive significance</mark>of technology are <br>
            numerous to mention, but i shall just discuss a few of them.
                   <ul>
                         <li><h3><i>Simple delivery of services</i></h3></li>
                        <li><h3><i>Reduction of the cost of production</i></h3></li>
                         <li><h3><i>Treatment of cancer</i></h3></li>
                          <li><h3><i>Impovement in communication</i></h3></li>
                          <li><h3><i>Security management</i></h3></li>
                   </ul>
      <p>delivery of services have been enhanced since the modern day technology came. The patients who are at very critical conditions but are very far from hospitals<br>
            can now get access to services digitaly via their mobile phones. Drones are also used to deliver equipements and medicines to those areas that can not be <br>
            accessed easily.<br><br><br>

      <p>The amount by which technology has reduced the amount of production is quite ramarakable given the significant roles it has played in the past and even what<br>
      it does today.For insatnce, in manufacturing, alot of technology is already delpoyed to accomplish several tasks which includes moving of machines,sorting and even <br>
packaging.This has contributed to major savings in the production industries as the cost of labour is significantly cut down.<br><br>
       <p>Alot have been achieved in communication industry using technology. As a matter of fact, today's communication industries is fully run using technology.<br>
      People nolonger have to walk long distances like it was in the past, devices are also made more and more portable and convinient to use these days.That is the <br>
the reason why we need to appreciate the advancement in technology and its positive implications.</p>
